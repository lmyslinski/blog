I've spent a significant amount of time working with GPUs in Kubernetes. As I was building [MLNative](https://www.mlnative.com/), I found Nvidia's GPU Operator a go-to solution when working with multiple clouds. Unfortunately, Nvidia's documentation leaves much to be desired. In this guide, I will cover the following:

- What is the GPU Operator
- What are the individual components & how do they work together
- How to use the GPU Operator
- Common pitfalls & troubleshooting
